After that, ACN Link can automatically create (and later remove) DNS records for every custom domain you add — without pasting API tokens.\n\nACN Link never writes customer DNS using the platform owner’s Cloudflare account.\n\nTABLE:STATUS\nWhat you see|Meaning\nConnected|ACN Link has permission to add/remove DNS in your Cloudflare account.\nNot connected|Use Connect Domain → Cloudflare Auto setup, or add DNS manually.\nReconnect|Approve Cloudflare again (token expired, wrong account, or new permissions).\nDisconnect|Remove access. Auto DNS stops. Domains stay in ACN until you delete them.\n\nHOW CONNECT WORKS (TODAY)\n\n1. Custom Domains → Connect Domain → enter an address (example: tree.ezysellonline.com) and pick a bio page.\n2. Choose Cloudflare → Auto setup → approve ACN Link in Cloudflare (one time).\n3. ACN creates the CNAME (or A for root domains) in YOUR zone.\n4. Status moves to LIVE when DNS + HTTPS are ready.\n5. Remove Domain deletes the ACN domain and removes that DNS record from Cloudflare when still connected.\n\nTABLE:RULES\nRule|Detail\nMany domains per user|shop.brand.com, link.brand.com, tree.brand.com — all OK on one account.\nOne domain per bio page|Each bio page can use only one custom domain at a time.\nOther DNS hosts|GoDaddy, Hostinger, etc. use guided copy steps (auto-connect coming soon).\n\nWHERE TO CLICK IN THE APP\n\n• Orange Cloudflare logo (top of Custom Domains) → manage Connect / Reconnect / Disconnect\n• (i) info button next to the logo → short explanation\n• Help (grey) → this Help Center article\n• How it works (under Connected domains) → example walkthrough popup"

Perfect — read this like a short story.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nTHREE WAYS TO SHARE YOUR PAGE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nA) FREE ACN URL (easiest — no domain needed)\n   Example: priya-shop.acnlink.mindflo.today\n   Where: Bio Pages → Get free URL\n   Good when: you are testing or do not own a domain yet.\n\nB) ROOT DOMAIN (your main website name)\n   Example: priyafashion.com\n   Also opens: www.priyafashion.com\n   Good when: you bought priyafashion.com and want that exact name.\n\nC) SUBDOMAIN (a prefix before your domain)\n   Example: link.priyafashion.com or shop.priyafashion.com\n   Good when: your main site stays somewhere else, but one link should open your ACN bio page.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWORDS YOU WILL SEE (SIMPLE MEANING)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n• Domain — the website name you type in the browser (priyafashion.com).\n• Root / apex domain — priyafashion.com with nothing in front.\n• Subdomain — the part before the domain (link. in link.priyafashion.com).\n• DNS provider — where you edit DNS records (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, Hostinger, Amazon Route 53, etc.). ACN detects this automatically and shows the name on your domain card.\n• A record — points a name to an IP address (used for root domains).\n• CNAME record — points a name to another hostname (used for subdomains).\n• Connect Domain — the wizard button in Custom Domains.\n• Test Connection — checks if DNS is correct after you save records.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nTHE FULL JOURNEY (ALL TYPES)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nStep 1 — Build and publish your bio page first.\nStep 2 — Sidebar → Custom Domains → Connect Domain.\nStep 3 — Type your address exactly:\n        • Root: priyafashion.com (no www, no https://)\n        • Subdomain: link.priyafashion.com (full address including the prefix)\nStep 4 — Choose which bio page should open when someone visits that address.\nStep 5 — ACN shows which DNS host we detected and the exact records to copy.\nStep 6 — Log in to THAT provider (not a random one) and add the records.\nStep 7 — Wait 2–15 minutes for DNS to update worldwide.\nStep 8 — Back in ACN → Test Connection (plug icon on the domain row).\nStep 9 — Status becomes Verified → open your domain in the browser and celebrate.\n\nStatus meanings:\n• Pending DNS — records missing or still propagating.\n• DNS Verified / Provisioning SSL — almost there; HTTPS finishing.\n• Verified — live. Share the link.\n• OFFLINE on the card — DNS still points elsewhere; fix records and Test again.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWHICH GUIDE TO READ NEXT?\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n→ Root domain story (priyafashion.com): open \"Story guide: Connect a root domain\"\n→ Subdomain story (link.priyafashion.com): open \"Story guide: Connect a subdomain\"\n→ Exact buttons in the app: open \"Step-by-step: Connect Domain wizard\"\n→ Stuck on Pending DNS?: open \"Troubleshooting: domain not verifying\""

In ACN Link he created a bio page called \"Sneaker Shop\" with buttons, WhatsApp, and a product gallery.\n\nHe does NOT want to share:\n  https://acnlink.mindflo.today/p/something-long\n\nHe WANTS people to type:\n  sneakershop.com\n\nThat is a ROOT DOMAIN connection. Here is exactly what Arun did.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 1 — OPEN THE RIGHT PAGE IN ACN\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n1. Log in to ACN Link.\n2. Left sidebar → Custom Domains.\n3. Top right → Connect Domain (blue button).\n\nDo not look for this inside Publish — custom domains live only on the Custom Domains page.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 2 — ENTER THE ROOT DOMAIN\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nIn the wizard Arun typed:\n  sneakershop.com\n\nRules:\n• No https://\n• No www. (www is handled separately via DNS)\n• Just the bare domain: yourbrand.com\n\nHe selected bio page: Sneaker Shop → Continue.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 3 — ACN FINDS WHERE DNS LIVES\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nACN checked nameservers and showed:\n  \"DNS at GoDaddy\"\n\nImportant: ACN shows YOUR real provider. If you see Amazon Route 53, Namecheap, Hostinger, or Cloudflare — edit DNS there, not somewhere else.\n\nIf you bought the domain on Hostinger but moved nameservers to Cloudflare, you edit Cloudflare — trust the name ACN shows.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 4 — ADD TWO A RECORDS (ROOT ONLY)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nACN showed something like:\n\n  Record 1\n  Type: A\n  Name / Host: @  (means root — some panels say \"@\" or leave blank)\n  Value / Points to: 69.46.46.90  (use the IP ACN shows on YOUR screen)\n\n  Record 2\n  Type: A\n  Name / Host: www\n  Value / Points to: same IP as above\n\nArun logged into GoDaddy → DNS → Add both records → Save.\n\nCloudflare users: turn Proxied (orange cloud) ON for both records.\n\nRemove OLD A records that point to a previous website host (old Hostinger IP, old Wix IP, etc.). Duplicate @ records cause \"still opens another site\" errors.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 5 — WAIT, THEN TEST\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nDNS is not instant. Arun waited 5 minutes, then in ACN Link:\n\nCustom Domains → sneakershop.com row → Test Connection (plug icon).\n\nFirst try: Pending DNS (normal if records just saved).\nSecond try after 10 minutes: DNS Verified → then Verified.\n\nHe could also expand \"Show DNS\" on the card to copy values again.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 6 — OPEN THE LIVE SITE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nWhen status = Verified, Arun clicked his domain name on the card.\n\nBoth work:\n  https://sneakershop.com\n  https://www.sneakershop.com\n\nHis ACN bio page opens with HTTPS.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nROOT DOMAIN CHECKLIST (COPY THIS)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n☐ Bio page built and published\n☐ Custom Domains → Connect Domain\n☐ Entered yourbrand.com (root only)\n☐ Picked the correct bio page\n☐ Added A record @ → ACN IP\n☐ Added A record www → same IP\n☐ Removed old conflicting A records\n☐ Waited a few minutes\n☐ Test Connection until Verified\n☐ Opened domain in browser\n\nNote: You only change DNS at your domain provider.

If your IT team owns DNS, send them the CNAME ACN shows.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 3 — ADD ONE CNAME RECORD\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nACN showed something like:\n\n  Type: CNAME\n  Name / Host: link\n    (some panels want only \"link\", not the full link.vickysfitness.com)\n  Target / Value: acnlink.mindflo.today\n    (use the exact target ACN shows on YOUR screen)\n\nCloudflare: Proxied (orange cloud) is OK.\n\nDo NOT add A records for a subdomain connection — use CNAME unless ACN explicitly says otherwise.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTEP 4 — TEST AND GO LIVE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nWait a few minutes → Test Connection on the domain row.\n\nWhen Verified, open:\n  https://link.vickysfitness.com\n\nVicky’s bio page loads.

      "STORY — \"I CLICKED TEST 10 TIMES BUT STILL PENDING\"\n\nMeera connected ditto.com. The card said OFFLINE and Pending DNS. She was editing Cloudflare — but her domain actually used Amazon Route 53. No wonder nothing changed.\n\nLesson: always edit DNS where the card says \"DNS at [Provider]\".\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 1 — WRONG DNS WEBSITE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSymptom: You add records but Test never passes.\n\nFix:\n1. Read the badge on your domain row: \"DNS at GoDaddy\" (example).\n2. Log in to THAT site only.\n3. Add records exactly as Show DNS lists them.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 2 — ROOT VS SUBDOMAIN MIX-UP\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSymptom: Added A records but you wanted link.yourbrand.com.\n\nFix: Subdomains need CNAME, not @/www A records. Remove wrong records. Re-run wizard with full subdomain typed.\n\nSymptom: Added CNAME but you wanted yourbrand.com.\n\nFix: Root needs A record @ only. Connect www.yourbrand.com separately as a subdomain (CNAME) if needed.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 3 — OLD RECORDS STILL POINTING ELSEWHERE\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSymptom: Message says site \"still opens another website\".\n\nFix:\n• Delete extra @ A records (only one correct IP should remain).\n• Remove parking page or old host IPs.\n• For www, point to the same ACN IP (or CNAME if your provider requires).\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 4 — DNS NOT PROPAGATED YET\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSymptom: Records look correct in provider but ACN says Pending.\n\nFix: Wait 5–30 minutes. TTL and registrar speed vary. Test again — do not change records every minute.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 5 — HTTPS / SSL STUCK AFTER DNS OK\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSymptom: DNS Verified but not Verified yet.\n\nFix: Wait a few minutes. Click Refresh / Test Connection on the domain row. No hosting panel setup is required — only DNS at your domain provider.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPROBLEM 6 — CANNOT DELETE A DOMAIN\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nFix: Click trash on the domain row. If error persists, refresh the page and try again, or contact support with the domain name.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTILL STUCK?\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nContact Support with:\n• Domain name\n• Root or subdomain\n• Screenshot of DNS records from your provider\n• Screenshot of ACN Custom Domains card\n\nWe will help you finish the connection."

Build your bio pages\n2. Help Center → Custom Domains category → read \"Start here: Custom domains for complete beginners\"\n3. Open Custom Domains → Connect Domain → follow the story guide for root or subdomain\n4. Click Publish to go live and share the URL\n\nTip: Domain connect/manage is only on Custom Domains. Publish is only for go-live and visibility. For a free URL without buying a domain, use Get free URL on Bio Pages."
